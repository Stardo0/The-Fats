# FriendServer Website README

Welcome to the FriendServer website!

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of the FriendServer website, designed to enhance the user experience for friends to connect and enjoy online activities. As of now, the website allows users to create and host game servers, with the aim of adding enhanced privacy features and admin tools in future updates.

## Current Features

1. **Server Hosting**: You can create and host your own game servers for your favorite games. Share the IP with your friends to play together.

2. **User Experience**: We are dedicated to improving the user experience continuously. Your feedback is valuable to us, and we appreciate your input.

## Future Developments

We have exciting plans for the future:

1. **Enhanced Privacy**: In future releases, we will hide server IPs to protect user privacy. No more sharing IPs with your friends.

2. **Admin Tools**: An admin interface is in the works, giving server admins more control. Configure settings and manage users conveniently through a web interface.

3. **Feature Requests**: We encourage you to share your ideas and suggestions. Your feedback helps us make FriendServer better for you.

## Getting Started

To get started, sign up for a FriendServer account and start hosting your servers. Share the fun with your friends and look forward to upcoming features and updates.
