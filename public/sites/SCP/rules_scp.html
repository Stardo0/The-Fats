            <div id="subtitle">Here are the rules for our SCP:SL server:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rule 1:</strong> Treat everyone with respect. This doesnâ€™t mean you should praise and compliment everyone, joking and "annoying people" is still allowed as long as it is within appropriate standards. If people start complaining, lower your implications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rule 2:</strong> Intentional team-killing is not allowed. Upon a reported team-kill, the Staff team can respawn you if a valid reason is provided. If you die in a crossfire or in an accident due to miscommunication, you will not be able to be respawned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rule 3:</strong> Spawn-killing and spawn-trapping is not allowed. If someone reports these types of misconducts, you and everyone in your team on the spawn-area will be eliminated without hesitation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rule 4:</strong> Gameplay-Sabotage is not tolerated at all. Upon report of gameplay sabotage, immediate action will be taken. It may result in a kick or a temporary ban from the server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rule 5:</strong> Admin abuse towards members without the power to defend themselves is forbidden. If you notice any instance of admin abuse on the server, it is up to you to report it.
                </li>
            </ul>
